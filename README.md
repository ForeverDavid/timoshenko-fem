# The Finite Element Method: Examples with a Timoshenko Beam and Poisson's Equation

This project is a small example of coding the finite element method. The first 
coded example is to determine the modal frequencies of a Timoshenko cantilever.
The second solves Poisson't equation which models many physical phenomena.


## Poisson's Equation

Poisson's equation results from modeling in many physcial domains including
heat conduction and electrostatics. The example coded in `poisson_fem.py` is 
used to determine the temperature field `T(x,y)` resulting from a set of 
heat sources `Q(x,y)` on a rectangular structure with varying heat conductivity
`k(x,y)`.

Three different approaches to assembling are explored. By far the worst is
creating a block diagonal sparse matrix and then applying constraints. The
standard iterative method has good performance. However, an approach building
the contents of the sparse matrix using vector operations was the fastest.
